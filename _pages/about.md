I am Professor of Economics in the [Department of Economics in the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia](https://www.terry.uga.edu/academics/offices/economics/), and a Fellow of the [Global Labor Organization](https://glabor.org/wp/), a Research Fellow with the [Institute of Labor Economics (IZA)](https://www.iza.org/). Between 2017 and 2023 I also worked as a research economist with the Center for Enterprise Dissemination - Disclosure Avoidance at the U.S. Census Bureau. My research focuses on how regulations and social institutions affect earnings and job mobility. I have studied job referral networks, compensating differentials, racial discrimination, the gender wage gap, and the effects of minimum wages on turnover. I also study data privacy, focusing on the trade-off between privacy and accuracy in the publication of official statistics.
