## Who am I?

I am Associate Professor in the Department of Economics in the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia. I also hold an appointment as a research economist with the Center for Disclosure Avoidance Research at the U.S. Census Bureau, and am a Fellow of the [Global Labor Organization](https://glabor.org/wp/). My research focuses on how regulations and social institutions affect earnings and job mobility. I have studied job referral networks, compensating differentials, racial discrimination, the gender wage gap, and the effects of minimum wages on turnover. Recently, I am also very interested in understanding the trade-off between data privacy and accuracy in the publication of official statistics.
