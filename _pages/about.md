I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Economics in the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia](http://www.terry.uga.edu/academics/offices/economics/). I also hold an appointment as a research economist with the Center for Enterprise Dissemination - Disclosure Avoidance at the U.S. Census Bureau, and am a fellow of the [Global Labor Organization](https://glabor.org/wp/) and the [Labor Dynamics Institute](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute). My research focuses on how regulations and social institutions affect earnings and job mobility. I have studied job referral networks, compensating differentials, racial discrimination, the gender wage gap, and the effects of minimum wages on turnover. I also study data privacy, focusing on the trade-off between privacy and accuracy in the publication of official statistics.
