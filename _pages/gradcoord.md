## For Prospective Students

If you are thinking about applying to one of our graduate programs, here are responses to some [frequently asked questions](/gradcoord/faq.html)

### The AB/MA Degree Program

* Our AB/MA programs are tailored to students who want to delve deeply into economic research. We think of it as a "PhD-light" experience, and you will complete essentially the first two years of a PhD program alongside your bachelor's degree. It is an intellectually rewarding, but very tough course of study.

* Your first point of contact for the AB/MA program should be the Academic Advisor for Economics. You can [email them here](mailto://econua@uga.edu).

* UGA does not offer a stand-alone master's program. Students already pursuing a bachelor's degree can apply for our [AB/MA degree](https://www.terry.uga.edu/economics/prospective-ab-ma.php) through the [Double Dawgs program](http://doubledawgs.uga.edu/). However, we only admit external students into our PhD program.

### The PhD Program

* We offer a competitive funding package and generally only admit students that we can support on an assistantship. The standard assistantship package is renewable for five years and provides a stipend and tuition waiver.

* There is no official GRE cutoff for admission to the PhD program at UGA. However, competitive applicants generally have a score above the 95th percentile on the quantitative portion. We will not waive the GRE requirement.

* All applicants whose first language is not English must submit scores from the TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo taken during the last two years. Per Graduate School guidelines. If you have completed a degree in an English-speaking country in the last two years, you may request a waiver of the test requirement from the graduate school. English-language instruction is an important part of our PhD program, and we generally require non-native speakers to have a very good speak-score on TOEFL or IELTS. Exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis during the admissions review.

* Unfortunately, we cannot waive application fees.
