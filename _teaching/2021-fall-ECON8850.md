   This is a reading course on specific topics in labor economics. It is not part of the field sequence in labor economics, and is open to students who have already take ECON 8410 and ECON 8420 and those that have not. 
   The ultimate goal is to prepare participants to conduct new research in labor economics. Toward that end, we will carefully study the literature on a few topics with the aim of locating the research frontier.
