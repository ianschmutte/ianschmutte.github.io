The modern world is awash in a seemingly unlimited amount of data. To harness these data for decisions starts with acquiring the raw information and ends with a report describing the outcome of some analysis. At each step, the analyst combines data with some ideas about how the world works to produce an output. BUSN 5000 will take a hands-on approach, with a focus on techniques of data preparation; descriptive, explanatory and predictive analyses; and scientific communication.

I teach this course jointly with Prof. Chris Cornwell. We are teaching two sections this semester. In each section, I will teach the first half of the semester and Prof. Cornwell will teach the second half.
