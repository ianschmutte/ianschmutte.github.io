### The AB/MA Degree Program

*  Current UGA students who are already pursuing a bachelor's degree may be eligible to apply for our [AB/MA degree](https://www.terry.uga.edu/economics/degrees/prospective-ab-ma) through the [Double Dawgs program](https://doubledawgs.uga.edu/).
* Our AB/MA programs are tailored to students who want to delve deeply into economic research. It is a "PhD-light" experience, as you will essentially complete the first two years of a PhD program while finishing your bachelor's degree. It is an intellectually rewarding, but very tough course of study.
* To be eligible for the AB/MA program, you need to have completed a lot of math prior to your senior year. Most students have successfully completed Calculus III, Introduction to Higher Mathematics, and Linear Algebra. 
* UGA does not offer a stand-alone terminal master's degree program.  If you are not a current UGA student, I am afraid you cannot apply to UGA for an MA in Economics. You might consider our PhD program instead.
* Your first point of contact for the AB/MA program should be the Academic Advisor for Economics. You can [email them here](mailto://econua@uga.edu).

### The UGA PhD Program in Economics

* We offer a competitive funding package and generally only admit students that we can support on an assistantship. The standard assistantship package is renewable for five years and provides a stipend and tuition waiver.
* All applicants are automatically considered for both admissions and funding simultaneously.
* There is no need to make contact with current faculty or to find a faculty mentor prior to applying.
* The GRE is required to be considered for admission. There are no waivers of this requirement.
* There is no official GRE score cutoff for admission to the PhD program at UGA. However, competitive applicants generally have a score above the 95th percentile on the quantitative portion. 
* All applicants whose first language is not English must submit scores from the TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo taken during the last two years. Per [Graduate School guidelines](https://grad.uga.edu/index.php/prospective-students/international-application-information/international-supplement/english-language-proficiency-requirement/), if you have completed a degree in an English-speaking country in the last two years, you may request a waiver of the test requirement from the Graduate School.
* Unfortunately, we cannot waive application fees.
* You can submit unofficial test scores and transcripts for us to consider during admissions review. You need only submit official versions once we decide to offer admission.

### Applying to Graduate School in Economics

* The [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/grad-prep) has a great set of resources for students starting to think about graduate school in Economics.
* Admissions for PhD programs are highly competitive and require a lot of preparation in Economics and Mathematics. I strongly recommend taking as much math as possible as early as possible.
* It is also important to understand, and if possible get engaged in, economic research before applying. You should engage in activities sponsored by the UGA Economics Society and Women in Economics. I also recommend meeting with your Economics professors to discuss your interest in a PhD early on in your time at UGA.
