### The AB/MA Degree Program

* UGA does not offer a stand-alone master's program. Current UGA students who are already pursuing a bachelor's degree can apply for our [AB/MA degree](https://www.terry.uga.edu/economics/prospective-ab-ma.php) through the [Double Dawgs program](https://doubledawgs.uga.edu/). We do not admit non-UGA students into our MA program, but they are eligible for our PhD program.

* Our AB/MA programs are tailored to students who want to delve deeply into economic research. We think of it as a "PhD-light" experience, and you will complete essentially the first two years of a PhD program alongside your bachelor's degree. It is an intellectually rewarding, but very tough course of study.

* Your first point of contact for the AB/MA program should be the Academic Advisor for Economics. You can [email them here](mailto://econua@uga.edu).

### The PhD Program

* We offer a competitive funding package and generally only admit students that we can support on an assistantship. The standard assistantship package is renewable for five years and provides a stipend and tuition waiver.

* All applicants are automatically considered for both admissions and funding simultaneously.

* There is no need to make contact with current faculty or to find a faculty mentor prior to applying.

* The GRE is required to be considered for admission. There are no waivers of this requirement.

* There is no official GRE score cutoff for admission to the PhD program at UGA. However, competitive applicants generally have a score above the 95th percentile on the quantitative portion. 

* All applicants whose first language is not English must submit scores from the TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo taken during the last two years. Per [Graduate School guidelines](http://grad.uga.edu/index.php/prospective-students/international-application-information/international-supplement/english-language-proficiency-requirement/), if you have completed a degree in an English-speaking country in the last two years, you may request a waiver of the test requirement from the graduate school. English-language instruction is an important component of our PhD program, and we generally require non-native speakers to have a very good speak-score on TOEFL or IELTS. Exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis during the admissions review.

* Unfortunately, we cannot waive application fees.

* You can submit unofficial test scores and transcripts for us to consider during admissions review. You need only submit official versions once we decide to offer admission.
