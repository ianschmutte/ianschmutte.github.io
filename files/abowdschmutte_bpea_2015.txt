  abstract={This paper explores the consequences for economic research
of methods used by data publishers to protect the privacy of their respondents.
We review the concept of statistical disclosure limitation for an audience of
economists who may be unfamiliar with these methods. We characterize what it
means for statistical disclosure limitation to be ignorable. When it is not ignorable,
we consider the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for a variety of
research designs common in applied economic research. Because statistical
agencies do not always report the methods they use to protect confidentiality, we
also characterize settings in which statistical disclosure limitation methods are
discoverable; that is, they can be learned from the released data. We conclude
with advice for researchers, journal editors, and statistical agencies.},
