## Abstract

We evaluate a strategy for using matched employer-employee data to estimate compensating
wage differentials. We apply this strategy to study occupational safety using
data on the universe of jobs in Brazil from 2003â€“-2010. In these data, common panel based
approaches actually amplify downward bias from nonrandom assignment to jobs.
We argue that when firms offer differentiated jobs, the direct effect on wages of moving
between jobs with different amenities can be identified by conditioning on unobserved
establishment-level heterogeneity. Our preferred model approximates the wage structure
well, while relaxing the key assumption that mobility between jobs with different
amenities is conditionally exogenous
