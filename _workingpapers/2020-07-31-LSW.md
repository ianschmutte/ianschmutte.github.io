## Abstract

We use Texasâ€™ constitutional amendment in 1997 that expanded the scope of home
equity loans as a source of exogenous variation to estimate the effects of relaxing
credit constraints on small businesses. We find, using standard panel data methods
and restricted-use microdata from the US Census Bureau, that the Texas amendment
increased the use of home equity finance by small businesses, increased new business
and job creation and reduced establishment exit and job loss. The effects are larger
and significant for businesses with fewer than ten employees.
