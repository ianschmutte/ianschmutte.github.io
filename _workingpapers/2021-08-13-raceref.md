## Abstract

We study how referral hiring contributes to racial inequality in firm-level labor demand over
the firm’s life cycle using data from Brazil. We consider a search model where referral networks
are segregated, firms are more informed about the match quality of referred candidates, and
some referrals are made by non-referred employees. Consistent with the model, we find that
firms are more likely to hire candidates and less likely to dismiss employees of the same race as
the founder, but these differences diminish as firms’ cumulative hires increase. Referral hiring
helps to explain racial differences in dismissals, seniority, and employer size.
