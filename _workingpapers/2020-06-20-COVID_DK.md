## Abstract

Policies that preserve productive employment relationships are particularly important in recessions. 
The collapse of economic activity during the pandemic was unlike any modern recession. 
We document the result of a national policy response including publicly subsidized
furloughs that allowed workers to keep their jobs through the recession. The policy allowed
for low unemployment and for the labor market to stabilize relatively quickly. Such policies
are expensive with hard-to-measure benefits. Using novel survey and administrative data from
Denmark, we find the policy was effective at a net cost of US$15 and US$127 per furloughed
day for part- and full-time workers respectively
