## Abstract

We test Shimer's (2005) theory of the sorting of workers between
and within industrial sectors based on directed search with coordination
frictions, deliberately maintaining its static general equilibrium
framework. We fit the model to sector-specific wage, vacancy and output
data, including publicly-available statistics that characterize the
distribution of worker and employer wage heterogeneity across sectors. Our
empirical method is general and can be applied to a broad class of
assignment models. The results indicate that industries are the loci of
sorting--more productive workers are employed in more productive industries.
The evidence confirms that strong assortative matching can be present even when
worker and employer components of wage heterogeneity are weakly correlated.
