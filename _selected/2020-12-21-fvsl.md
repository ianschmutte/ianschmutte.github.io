## Abstract

We use Brazilian matched employer-employee data to provide new evidence on gender
disparities in labor market sorting on wages and workplace safety. We show that women
and men sort in highly disparate, but systematic, ways on the basis of physical risk, despite
sorting almost identically on financial risk. To understand what factors might explain these
gender differences in sorting, we begin by ruling out the possibility that men and women
receive different compensating wage differentials for risk. We find that women do earn
smaller establishment wage premia than men on average, but this difference is also unlikely
to explain the sorting patterns. Despite having little direct effect on wages, sorting on safety
has an outsized influence on the segregation of women and men across establishments. This
segregation results in men earning substantially higher establishment wage premia, which
explains nearly one-third of the entire gender wage gap in Brazil.
